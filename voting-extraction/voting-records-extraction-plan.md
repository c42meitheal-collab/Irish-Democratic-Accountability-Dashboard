2. **Secondary**: Manual verification via Oireachtas website
   - URLs: `https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/vote/dail/[DATE]/`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### **Phase 1: API Extraction Script**
```javascript
// Oireachtas API extraction for key votes
const extractVotingRecords = async (voteDate, billTitle) => {
    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.oireachtas.ie/v1/debates?date=${voteDate}&chamber=dail&debate_type=vote`
    );
    
    const data = await response.json();
    
    // Extract individual TD votes
    return data.results.map(vote => ({
        td_name: vote.member.fullName,
        party: vote.member.party.showAs,
        constituency: vote.member.constituency.showAs,
        vote_cast: vote.vote.voteType, // 'For', 'Against', 'Abstain'
        bill_title: billTitle,
        date: voteDate
    }));
};
```

### **Phase 2: Data Validation**
- Cross-reference against manual Oireachtas records
- Verify TD names match property database
- Validate vote categorization (pro-tenant vs anti-tenant)

### **Phase 3: Political Impact Scoring**
```javascript
const calculateHypocrisyScore = (td) => {
    let score = 0;
    
    // Base hypocrisy: Properties owned
    score += td.property_count * 5;
    
    // Anti-tenant votes while owning rental properties
    score += td.anti_tenant_votes * 15;
    
    // Government position bonus
    if (td.government_position) score += 25;
    
    // Electoral vulnerability bonus (pressure effectiveness)
    if (td.electoral_margin < 5) score += 20;
    
    return Math.min(score, 100); // Cap at 100
};
```
